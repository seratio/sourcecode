								<h2><span>The Arts</span></h2>
								<br>
								<p align="justify">
									The Arts are what makes the human race thrive, from cultural development to the cohesion of entire communities an nations it serves as a bedrock to humanity and society on earth. Arts take many forms â from a historical to a cultural context, dance and music to theatre and the visual arts, the arts give humans a unique means of expression. Most importantly the arts have served as an effective mechanism for people to embed morality and social impacts capturing their passions and emotions whilst breaking down barriers, be they racial, political, cultural or financial. The true impact of the arts upon society has seldom been measured forma social perspective or a holistic value perspective. Its ability to look at the way we explore new ideas, subject matter, and cultures â and the direct correlations that has upon special good in both quantitative and qualitative ways has never been universally agreed. At Seratio we are not only developing these unique methods of measuring the impacts arts have â but we are turning our attention to the way in which investment in the arts has social returns in monetary values within communities and how it can also help the public sector authorities in all economies around the world, regardless of size or strength.
								</br></br>The Arts and its variety of offshoots communicates to us  and improves us in ways that help us understand more about each other and enhance our lives in ways we have not fully understood or explored. At Seratio we hope to become the forerunners to a new perspective on the impacts of arts in society â we staunchly believe that we must as a human race continue to find a place for arts programs and partnerships not only for what it teaches students about art, but for what it teaches us all about the world we live in.<br><br>

Research from some of our partners in the world of academia clearly shows that the correlation between happiness and investment is particularly strong for young and disruptive SMEs which the Harvard business review terms âless codified decision making processâ powered by the âyounger and less experienced managers who are more likely to be influenced by sentiment.ââ For us at Seratio the truth comes from sophisticated sentiment analysis â knowing what inhabitants of a city think and feel about their surroundings and articulating that value in terms of evidence based numbers. We also believe that we need to create a more fair and equal society using the very latest technology and the people of the world in a united fashion â a sentiment backed by research which shows that the  relationship between wealth, happiness and equality âwas also stronger in places where happiness was spread more equallyâ. We have worked closely with many corporate partners and increasingly we are finding that firms seem to invest more in places where most people are relatively happy â helping the rich to become richer rather than focusing on areas of need. The solutions we have developed concentrate on these places with happiness âinequality, or large gaps in the distribution of well-being.â They show corporates where their social and financial investment can make the biggest REAL impacts and how they can articulate that return on investment to their stakeholders in terms of definitive value.

							<p align="justify">
								The Banking and Financial Services sectors are set for transformation as their role, industry structure and commercial environments become disrupted by social innovation and a greater awareness of societal change.
								The major trends currently reshaping the global economy have been established by the increasing awareness an.
								This progressive transformation means that many businesses will be unrecognisable by the end of the decade and evolution of market leaders or constituents of many leading stock indices could shaped by this shift.
								Those organisations which remain at the very cusp of social innovation and have the appropriate tools and frameworks to create smart and agile strategies will inevitably leapfrog more lethargic competitors.
								What major corporations will have to ask themselves is will their existing business model still be relevant in the new global economy? How can they take advantage of the shake-up ahead? How can they measure, record or even utilise something that they cannot understand?
								The answer comes from a hybridised solution from SERATIO
							</br></br>
							We have developed the appropriate metrics to give corporations of any size the ability to investigate and forecast the potential return on investment by appropriately resourcing impact investments.
							Further still, using the very latest sentiment analysis, scenario forecasting, benchmarking and deep machine learning we are the leading authority in measuring âthe intangible agents of changeâ.
							For every single financial metric and key performance indictor we have developed the analogous measurement methodology which translates and automates intangibles into a measurement that your firm can use to directly influence all corporate activity, from strategy to your bottom line. We have done this by combining the most powerful manual and digitally automated technologies â from mathematical modelling and formula creation, to the use of the semantic web, machine learning and artificial intelligence.
						</br></br>
						Founded in the UK, Seratio brings together to very best academic and business world talent. It is born out of the last financial crisis and has been used in many pioneering innovations in finance for impact, for example in the development of Social Impact Bonds as a structured finance product for social impact, the creation of socio-economic metrics for corporate stock indexes and in measuring intangible effects that your firm may have upon obscure but highly important societal problems such as slavery, animal welfare and violence.
						It is the world's only scalable, verifiable, cost effective and automated metric â measuring any dimension of social impact every 10 seconds.
					</br></br>
					We have ensured the technology is 100% translatable and transferable â whether you use Microsoft Excel or the most complex Big Data or Artificial Intelligence system â even pen and paper can be automated and translated by SERATIO

					<h2><span>Hyper Locality</span></h2>
					<br>
					<p align="justify">
						We all want to know more about the places we live, work or spend our social lives within. Understanding our environment, the complex interactions between people and physical assets such as parks, buildings and public spaces is not only an innate part of our human behaviour but also gives us wisdom on social norms and boundaries in the places we interact with. Ask yourself one very telling question â do you really know what is going on in your locality? Are you connected with your community and do you know the âword on the streetâ?

						This complex and ever changing information is what hyperlocality looks at â it is the data that is created around a well-defined community or the interaction between communities and the physical landscape around them. The world is globalising at an alarming rate and technology has served to accelerate the interactions and interdependencies communities have between each other, be it economic or social, each interaction is a form of trade. Hyperlocality investigates the real concerns of the population in any given community by looking at the trends in data, the conversations taking place by participants in any given community, the boundaries of which are fluid and ever evolving.
					</br>
				</br>
				At Seratio we use hyperlocality to extract important intelligence from communities and to help external and internal agents of change build community capacity.
				We help target the most effective methods of community growth be it social or economic by robustly determining which methods implant real value and social improvement - going beyond the now outdated concept of social investment as a blind science.
			</br></br>
			We use the very latest technology, leveraging the power of the emergent ecology of data to exploit these channels in order to measure and define the data behind hyperlocal events. These includes but are not limited to user interactions, heat map GIS analysis, aggregators, publication mechanisms, social media and behaviours of agents within a community unit. We focus on what the individual does within a community and the social value they impart upon their surroundings as well as the collective impacts of an entire community. Things need to be made simple for a decision to be reached and actions to be taken - so we can articulate the outcome in one single number. our methods are used to inform public sector services, corporate agents and any other interested group who form part of that community â in a non-partisan and unbiased manner.

					<h2><span>Consumer Index</span></h2>
					<br>
					<p align="justify">
						Thus far consumer orientated markets have concentrated upon developing measurements that examine the simplistic financial characteristics of the items households purchase, be they tangible goods such as food items or services such as car insurance.  The financial and economic focus of this âcommoditisation of goods or servicesâ have increasingly become essential components of capitalist societies.
						The major problem with current methodologies is that they do not give a full picture of the true value of the good or service the individual is purchasing. Take the standard Consumer Pricing Index (CPI) as a classic example. It is calculated by taking the expected or observed price changes for each item in the predetermined basket of goods and averaging them; then these goods are weighted according to their importance â an importance again predetermined by an economistâs model â not by you, the end user or consumer. Changes in CPI are used to assess price changes associated with the cost of living. These are very important because the corporations who make the goods or provide the service will adjust the pricing accordingly which affects you, the governments and public authorities of the world will also influence tax rates and assignment of political priorities based on the demand levels attributed to the CPI â which again directly affects you, the consumer.</br>
					</br>
					At Seratio we know the status quo in the industry of measuring and rating goods and services is not a reflection of the true value. We feel that as the agents of change the consumer should not be veiled by purely financial and economic measurements â they should have access to metrics and measurements that give them the detailed knowledge they need understand what they are buying and what affect that will have upon society at large. We combine the financial value with all intangible values attributed to the product or service you are about to purchase. We dare to ask questions that many corporations probably would not want you to know â as it may influence what you buy. Take the example of a T-shirt manufactured by a sweatshop in Asia or Africa â if you the consumer knew the true extent of social, political, economic and environmental damage that is done by you purchasing that item, you may think twice. At Seratio we go further â we attribute those measurements around you, we will be able to articulate the action of buying that item and benchmarking against your other purchasing habits, telling you what your consumer behaviour does to the society around you but also what good or bad you do around the world. It works two ways also â each and every corporation you interact with is measured in the same way â so now the consumer and the corporate are both equally responsible to make more informed choices.

						Our sole objective of being able to turn intangible outcomes in real, verifiable and accurate measurements. We do this using the very latest in academic knowledge which combines social science, outcome metrics, data mining and sentiment analysis.  The logical outcome is an elite set of supermetrics which are constructed using sentiment analysis, geo-located with future proof analytical technology reinforced with the latest big data mining and machine learning technology.<br></br>

						We aim to inform and empower  those responsible for making the decisions which ultimately have a positive or negative impact upon the world and all of those who aim to make a difference.  These people are not just those in executive boards of major corporations, those who reside in positions of power in government, but you, a consumer, a citizen of the world.  We focus upon informing the societies of the world<br></br>
						We believe that after decades of so called change agents trying to pioneer models of transformation from the top down â there now needs to be accurate measurements, provided by an elite, non-partisan entity which delivers the truth into the hands of the people. <br></br>

								<br>
								<p>Seratio have devised the most relevant, scalable and accurate metric for measuring social value. For decades many have tried to make sense of what has been until now truly intangible â devising âmeasurementsâ that simply fail to take consideration the âreal effectsâ into account. Thus far such measurements and metrics have been poorly adopted, subject to bias, too specific, not automated in any way and untranslatable. We aimed to put an end to the rather fuzzy world of social impact and social innovation and imbed it into scientific methods which can implement true change.</p>
								<p>During the previous financial crisis we were issued with the challenge of measuring more scientifically and accurately the real-time contributions corporate entities and indeed individuals make to the world around them. The Social to Earning Ratio devised by Seratio measures your impact beyond just the marketplace, showing you in hard numbers the efficiency of your social spend, in much the same way the standard P/E Ratio (Price to Earnings) measures the earnings of your company against costs.</p>
								<p>Indeed, we passionately believe that the current methodologies for measuring impact upon societies, the earth and institutions are out dated and no longer reflect the reality of what those inputs become in terms of impacts upon the grass roots or indeed intended targets. Most modern metrics also fail to utilize the huge technological advances that have occurred in the 21st century thus far. We focus on devising methodologies that are not designed to make corporations look good, but instead help the observer attain an accurate depiction of what really happens on the ground. </p>

							<div class="tab-pane" id="tab-2">
								<br>
								<p>WHEN THE FACTS ARE OUT IN THE OPEN â WE ALL BENEFIT, ITâS JUST HOW LIFE IS MEANT TO BE.</p>
								<p>The emphasis on pure financial value and outcomes no longer reflects reality in an ever changing world â we believe  in the new economy the true value of a brand or corporate entity  is now a combination of its Financial Value (P/E) and itâs Social Value (S/E).</p>
								<p>There has to date been a systematic failure which we aim to address using our expertise in intangible measurement and analysis, big data mining and qualitative data analysis â to create metrics which systematically and consistently can measure the direct ramifications of our actions, or non-actions. </p>

							</div>

							<div class="tab-pane" id="tab-3">
								<br>
								<p>Within the financial world, the Price/Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio or PER) is the main single index evaluation technique of economic performance and health check. Used throughout the world, and reported daily on stock exchanges, it has become the universally adopted tool. In rough terms, the P/E measures the capitalization of a company (what it's worth) against the amount of profit it generates. We have developed the corollary to the P/E, the S/E Ratio (SER) which measures the Social Impact of an organisation against the monies invested to achieve it (the earnings diverted which otherwise would be profit).</p>

								<p>A share price is a relatively weak artefact representing degrees of alignment between shareholders and the organisations. It is subject to numerous reported and unmeasured biases which mean it cannot in isolation reflect the true âvalueâ of the corporate entity. Generally only the shareholders and management benefit, and all others are a slave to that goal. Using human dynamic and descriptive analytics we have devised academically rigorous and peer reviewed methodologies which extend beyond these simple financial metrics.</p>

								<p>Think of yourself as a operator within a ever changing environment, the impacts you make upon the world around you will change constantly as the environment evolves. Your impact as a human being is not simply a constituent of your productivity or ability to make money.</p>
								<p>The social impact interpretation is that of citizenship, that the total value of an organisation is a total of the financial and social values. Taking social value, one has to measure the stakeholder value of customers, suppliers, staff, statutory bodies, community and the environment. </p>
								<p>Independently commissioned, the methodology has been developed by the Centre for Citizenship, Enterprise and Governance (cceg.org.uk) and its affiliated network of 30+ International Universities and Research Institutes to ensure honesty and integrity in the reporting process.</p>

								<p>Seratio reports in future proof XBRL format, using the latest GRI-4 template (Global Reporting Initiative) and is compliant with IIRC (The International Integrated Reporting Council).</p>

						<h2><span>Introduction</span></h2>
						<br>
						<p>  The Social Earnings Ratio came out of a leading team of academics that researched, re-modelled, and developed over a 3 year period (2011-2014) all the likely applications of a single universal non-financial metric. Working collaboratively now with over 40 universities in the world, we finally ended our testing period in Autumn 2014 and moved to implementation phase resulting in the seratio.com SaaS platform. Access to the Big Data we have harvested is by permission only, but many of our licensees across the world display parts of the data freely. Here we share with you a sample set of test data since 2011 to convey the exacting provenance of our research.
